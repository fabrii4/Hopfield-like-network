# Hopfield-like network

## Work in progress!

As briefly discussed in [Hopfield-like network.pdf](./Hopfield-like%20network.pdf), 
an Hopfield-like feed-forward network is capable to store and retrieve an 
indefinite number of patterns (given by the number of output neurons).

Experiments are in progress to determine if this mechanism could be useful in the realization of an unsupervised network 
for image segmentation/classification.
